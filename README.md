This repo is the supporting code for a full day ThingLabs workshop using Windows 10 IoT Core on a Rasberry Pi 2 (with a Grove kit) and Azure IoT services. 

In these IoT Labs you will begin by learning the basics of working with Windows 10 IoT Core connected to sensors and devices. You will move on to connecting the device to the Cloud. You will learn how to leverage Microsoft Azure services to collect data and control devices and use advanced services like analytics and machine learning to discover insights using your Things.
